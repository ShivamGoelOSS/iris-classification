# Classification of Iris Species
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify the species of Iris flowers based on their physical characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). Using the classic Iris dataset, this project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to solve a multi-class classification problem.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the Iris dataset.
- Implementation of machine learning models using Scikit-learn.
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy.
- Visualization of results with scatter plots.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset (Fisher's Iris Dataset)

## How It Works
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Features are analyzed to understand their relationship with the target labels.
- A machine learning model (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) is trained on the training set.
- Predictions are made on the test set, and the model's performance is evaluated.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into one of the three species:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

## Key Highlights
- Beginner-friendly implementation for understanding the basics of classification problems.
- Reproducible code and visualizations to aid in learning machine learning concepts.
- A modular design that allows easy expansion or integration of new models.

## Usage
Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to reproduce the results or extend the project.
